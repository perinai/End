Project Title: e.g., "AI-Powered Crop Yield Prediction for SDG 2: Zero Hunger"
Objective/Introduction: Briefly explain the project: addressing SDG 2 by predicting crop yields using machine learning. Mention the dataset source (e.g., "Kaggle dataset based on FAOSTAT data").
SDG Problem Addressed: A short paragraph on SDG 2 and the specific problem of crop yield unpredictability.
ML Approach Used:
"Supervised Learning (Regression)."
Mention the features used (Area, Item, Year).
Briefly describe preprocessing (One-Hot Encoding for categorical, StandardScaler for numerical).
State the models tried (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and that Random Forest was chosen as the best.
Key Results:
State the RÂ², MAE, and RMSE of your best Random Forest model on the test set.
Include a screenshot of your top feature importances plot.
(Optional) Include a screenshot of a key EDA plot (e.g., average yield over years or actual vs. predicted).
How to Run the Code:
Instructions for setting up (e.g., "Open in Google Colab").
Mention any specific libraries needed if they aren't standard Colab ones (though sklearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn are standard). You could create a requirements.txt if you were running locally, but for Colab it's less critical if you only use common libraries.
Where to place the dataset file (if it's not downloaded by the script).
Ethical Considerations (Brief Summary): A short version of your ethical reflection.
Project Demo Screenshots (if applicable): If you were to build a simple UI (stretch goal), you'd put screenshots here. For now, screenshots of your key Colab outputs (plots, metrics) are sufficient.
